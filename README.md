# Instagram_Reel_Analysis
This repository contains the notebook for instagram reel analysis

The notebook mainly performs 3 tasks:
1. Extract Reels metadata using RAPIDAPI
2. Download reel, split it to frames, transcribe the audio and perform frame by frame image analysis to get the video analysis in the form of transcribed audio and frame by frame video analysis at 1 FPS
3. Extract top 15 comments using RAPIDAPI
4. Use a judge LLM to check for Sentiment and Relevance between the reel content and comments with the help of Video data, transcribed audio, captions and comments

For Easier understanding, it is recommended to read the code as per the above tasks.

Further changes will be made to make this project easier to understand
